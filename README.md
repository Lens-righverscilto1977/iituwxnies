OMG okay so just came out of Henry Danger: The Movie and my brain's like a blender set to no-lid mode, you know? Like, tried to send this to you as a voice note but fingers had other plans, whatever. Ass-killing seats by the way, felt like I was sitting on a bag of angry raccoons gnawing at my spine.

> First off, so much chaos! Explosions felt like they were happening INSIDE my head, or maybe that's just the sugar rush from that mega popcorn with extra butter — yeah, Cardie! Popcorn shrapnel all over, I'll be finding kernels till next week haha! 

Dude, these kids! Henry and Ray — they’re flying everywhere like caffeinated pigeons on a mission. It’s like they downloaded the movie script from the caffeine cloud. Remember when the popcorn guy said, Enjoy the movie? Hah, should've said Brace yourself! That fight scene in space with the evil wormhole grandpa? Felt like my brain was unraveling like cheap yarn. 

And then that moment, whoa! The one where Henry turns to the camera, BREAKING the fourth wall like he’s swatting a fly, I actually thought someone was throwing gummy bears at me in 4D, or was it real? The theater’s acoustics were nuts too, like listening to a symphony in a tin can, echoes galore!

> OH, did Trina just end up fighting a shadow with, get this, a rubber chicken?? Symbolic of what? My attempts at adulting? Maybe. But real talk, she owned it better than my last therapy session. That's probably not saying much. 

Ray's jokes — like dad jokes but on a sugar-crammed roller coaster. I swear, watch the movie, you'll have whiplash from trying not to laugh. It's like they're traversing this alternate reality where physics decided to take a day off, just like my brain right now.

Yeah, someone was asking if they should download the movie but honestly, you need the theater chaos to feel the insanity really hugging you tight, like an unwanted surprise hug from your overly-sweaty uncle.

Anyway, need a second to process what just happened to me. Reality feels different, is gravity normal? Sending this while half expecting Henry to jump out from behind a tree, bonkers.

    return; // If I could return my sanity, I would.
